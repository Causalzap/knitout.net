## “Reinventing Myself”: Rollic’s Skin-Swap Strategy

### What Is a Skin-Swap?

A **skin-swap** keeps the core gameplay intact while changing:

- Characters
- Visual materials

This allows rapid iteration with **minimal design risk**.

### Skin-Swap Examples from Color Block Jam

- **Gecko Rush** — replaces blocks with gecko characters  
- **Slither Blast** — introduces snake-based visuals  
- **Blasty Stacks** — wood-texture theme aimed at overseas markets

- Android: March (current year)  

### Gameplay Overview

- Merge-based restoration gameplay  
- Text-driven narrative (no heavy cutscenes)  
- Players rebuild Barbie’s world by fulfilling merge orders  

### Marketing & Challenges
