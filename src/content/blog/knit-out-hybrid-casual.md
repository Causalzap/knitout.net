## Key Takeaways

- **Publisher:** Rollic Games (Turkey)  
- **Sub-genre:** Hybrid-casual; “unscrew / stack & clear” with a knitting skin  
- **Commercial signal:** IAP > **¥15M/mo**; soft-launched Jan; revenue inflected after May  
- **Design hook:** Match yarn rings to edge colors, wrap to 100% → clear; smaller cells later force planning

## What Is Knit Out?

If you’ve played *unscrew* titles, Knit Out will feel familiar yet fresher. It frames the stack-and-clear loop as **winding colored yarn rings** around a woven piece.

### Board Layout

- **Top:** Multi-color woven target  
- **Middle:** Limited holding slots  
- **Bottom:** Incoming yarn rings

### Core Loop

- Drop a ring into a slot matching the outer-edge color.  
- The ring auto-wraps; at **100% progress** the segment clears.  
- Later cells shrink and paths lengthen—demanding sequencing & slot management.  

Early levels are breezy and “oddly satisfying.” Late game leans into plan-ahead puzzle depth.

## Monetization: Ads First, Smart IAP Later

- **Rewarded ads** add slots or speed progress.  
- **Scissors** (consumable) cut mismatched color blocks.  
- **Remove Ads** IAP appears around level 20—after players value uninterrupted flow.  

*Why it works:* Cozy theme + clear friction (slots & mismatches) → low-cog ad / IAP. Players buy **time and board space**, not coin packs.

## User-Acquisition Creative: Life Elements Over Heavy Fiction

- **IQ-test overlays:** “High IQ clears faster.”  
- **Help-me hand** placing the next ring  
- **Pixel nostalgia** — retro filter, real loop  
- **Conveyor-belt fail** — over-stack = instant loss  
- **Go-stone metaphor** — black/white stones = yarn colors  

Familiar frames drop CPA while staying honest to gameplay—boosting retention.

## Why Revenue Spiked After May

- **Live-ops maturity:** cohort-tuned tools & Remove-Ads timing  
- **Level-curve retune:** smaller cells + longer wraps add friction  
- **Spendable pain points:** slots & scissors turn frustration into spend  
- **Scaled UA:** LTV validated → bigger budgets  

Rollic earlier turned *Color Block Jam* into **¥130M IAP in four months**—the playbook repeats.

## Design Notes for Developers

- **Theme–mechanic lock:** “Wrap to 100%” is self-explanatory → higher CVR  
- **Soft friction, crisp fixes:** limit slots, sell precise counters  
- **Earned Remove-Ads:** surface only after ad cost is *felt*  
- **UA truthiness:** stylize framing, keep real mechanics
