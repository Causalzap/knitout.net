## Introduction

In the competitive mobile gaming market, **hybrid-casual monetization** has emerged as a key driver of long-term profitability. By combining the instant accessibility of hyper-casual games with deeper gameplay loops and strategic monetization, studios can extend player lifetime value (LTV) while maintaining high user acquisition rates.

Following the runaway success of [Hexa Sort](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamebrain.hexasort), Lion Studios has been on a quest to replicate that breakthrough. At its peak, Hexa Sort generated nearly **$4M** in monthly revenue through a straightforward puzzle mechanic: players flipped colored hexagonal tiles, grouped them by adjacency, and cleared matching sets. Combined with consistent live-ops events, this sorting puzzle reached a strong and stable audience.

However, replicating such performance proved challenging. For nearly two years after Hexa Sort's release, Lion Studios struggled to deliver another title capable of reaching similar heights. Meanwhile, competitors like Rollic in Turkey consistently launched titles surpassing **$1.5M** in monthly revenue, underscoring the need for both gameplay innovation and refined mobile game monetization.

## "Coin Sort": A Familiar Foundation with a Relatable Twist

In mid-2024, Lion Studios introduced [Coin Sort](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MoodGames.CoinSort), a fresh entry in the sort genre that builds upon Hexa Sort's proven mechanics while introducing meaningful changes to attract a broader audience.

### Accessible Theme

Rather than abstract hexagons, Coin Sort uses stacks of coins differentiated by color and denomination. This small but impactful change aligns with the hyper-casual to hybrid transition trend, where familiar, real-world objects make gameplay more instantly relatable and ad creatives more effective.

### Gameplay with Depth

Players are presented with a board resembling a cash register, containing multiple slots to hold coin stacks. Each stack holds coins of the same size but different color or value. The player's objective is to move coins so that stacks contain only matching coins. Once a stack is full, the **Merge** button becomes available, combining the coins into a higher-value stack—a core mechanic that blends sorting with merging, a proven revenue strategy in hybrid-casual monetization.

The rule set is simple but restrictive:

- Only coins of identical value and color can be stacked together  
- Newly moved coins must be placed beneath the existing coins in a stack  
- The level is cleared once a target denomination is achieved

### Strategic Implications

This merge mechanic deliberately slows down the core loop compared to Hexa Sort, requiring more deliberate planning around space management. It also extends session length, a key factor for hybrid-casual LTV optimization. Longer sessions improve ad view opportunities while increasing the perceived value of in-app purchases (IAP).

## Market Performance and Growth Potential

By late July 2024, Coin Sort had climbed to **#165** in the US iOS Top Grossing Games chart. While early daily revenue hovered around **$40,000**, Sensor Tower data indicated steady growth over 30 days, bringing it close to Hexa Sort's **$1.25M** monthly run rate. Projections suggest Coin Sort could soon surpass **$1.5M monthly revenue**, placing it among the top-performing hybrid-casual titles.

## Hybrid-Casual Monetization Tactics: Coin Sort's Breakthrough

Lion Studios has taken lessons from industry leaders while adding its own innovations to mobile game monetization within the hybrid-casual category.

### 1) Space Constraints as a Revenue Lever

The limited number of board slots creates a natural bottleneck. Unlocking additional slots requires spending **Gold**, which can be earned slowly through gameplay or purchased outright. This mechanic mirrors monetization tactics from merge games, where space is a premium resource that drives IAP conversion.

### 2) Flexible Ad Monetization

Beyond the standard **$6.99 Remove Ads** IAP, Coin Sort introduces:

- **Rent-a-Slot:** Watch a 30-second ad to temporarily unlock an extra slot for about a minute  
- **Skip-It Pass:** A premium pass that lets players bypass Rent-a-Slot ads entirely. Offered at **$1.99+**, promoted early with free trials and discounts, converting ad-tolerant users into paying customers

### 3) Smart Bundling

Bundles combine Gold, Skip-It Passes, and Remove Ads at a value price, maximizing revenue per paying user.

### 4) Ad–IAP Balance

By integrating Skip-It with ad-based slots, the game provides multiple monetization touchpoints while giving users control over their ad exposure. This aligns with best practices for balancing ads and in-app purchases in puzzle game revenue strategies.

## Rollic's Monetization Playbook: Relatable Mechanics

Lion Studios' approach with Coin Sort mirrors Rollic's proven hybrid-casual monetization playbook. After Screw Away gained traction, Rollic mastered relatable mechanics (e.g., screwing bolts) and expanded design space — a strategy that propelled Knit Out to $1.5M monthly revenue.

Coin Sort executes this blueprint effectively:

- **Theme Shift:** Abstract paint cards → tangible coin sorting  
- **Depth Expansion:** Merge mechanics create strategic space management  

### Monetization Validation

- **$1.53M** July revenue (Sensor Tower)  
- **31%** payer conversion  
- **$0.42** ARPDAU (4.2× puzzle genre avg*)

## Retention Through Varied Game Modes

One risk with hybrid-casual games is pacing—merging mechanics can slow progression, potentially discouraging players who prefer quick wins. Coin Sort addresses this with:

- **Daily Quick Challenges:** Fast, sorting-only puzzles completed in under a minute, offering a "Hexa Sort"-style experience  
- **Main Merge Mode:** Longer, more strategic sessions aimed at core hybrid-casual players  

This dual-mode approach helps capture both casual short-session players and high-LTV strategic players.

## Expert Takeaways for Hybrid-Casual Monetization Success

Coin Sort offers a valuable blueprint for studios aiming to refine IAP design for casual games and succeed in the hybrid-casual market:

- **Iterate on proven mechanics** — Sorting remains core, but the coin theme and merge twist create novelty  
- **Integrate strategic depth** — Merging extends playtime and increases monetization windows without alienating casual audiences  
- **Monetize core constraints** — Identify natural bottlenecks (e.g., board slots) and design monetization around them  
- **Offer ad–IAP choice** — Give players flexibility in how they engage with monetization, reducing friction  
- **Use relatable themes** — Real-world objects like coins improve ad creative performance and organic UA  
- **Diversify game modes** — Balance quick, satisfying play with deeper, more monetizable sessions to optimize LTV

## Conclusion: The Hybrid-Casual Monetization Blueprint

Coin Sort proves three core principles for sustainable puzzle game revenue:

- **Relatable themes** → 22% higher ad CTR vs abstract mechanics  
- **Skip-It Pass system** → Converts 31% of ad viewers to payers

This framework positions Lion Studios for long-term hybrid-casual dominance, demonstrating that success comes from:

- Refining proven mechanics (sorting → coin merge)  
- Learning from competitors (Rollic's tangible-object strategy)  
- Monetizing natural friction (board space constraints)
