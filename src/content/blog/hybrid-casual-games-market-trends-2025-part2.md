## Core Insights & Conclusion

> **Key Takeaways:**
> - **Market concentration:** Rollic (3 titles) and Voodoo (2 titles) dominate half of the Top 10, same as Q1 2025.
> - **Barriers & fluidity:** Entry is tougher, but the Top 10 remains dynamic with opportunities for challengers.
> - **Case examples:** Hole People & Knit Out follow Color Block Jam's winning formula; Epic Plane Evolution showcases hyper-to-hybrid transition; [Screw Sort Puzzle™](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=screw.puzzle.match3.brain.puzz) proves mid-size studios can break through with disciplined monetization.

Hybrid casual growth stems not just from borrowing proven mechanics but also from smart UA strategies. Sticky core loops, viral themes, and optimized monetization lower CPI and unlock scalable potential.

By Q2 2025, hybrid casual games further consolidated their influence with no slowdown in sight. For developers, hybrid casual is no longer optional—it is the **growth playbook**. The earlier teams adapt, the more likely they are to lead rather than chase.
